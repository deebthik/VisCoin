|---VisCoin---|

This project was aimed as a blockchain incentivization system for drivers and solution to the problem of driver drowsiness. Signs for such scenarios were detected and quantified using OpenCV and empirical heuristics into a custom "drowsiness index" which was stored using IPFS. This metric was then used to reward or deduct a custom coin i.e. "VisCoin" to or from the driver's digital wallet, using smart contracts developed with Solidity.
