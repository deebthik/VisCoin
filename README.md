|---VisCoin---|

This project was a blockchain incentivization system for drivers, serving the solution to the problem of driver fatigue and drowsiness by detecting the signs for such scenarios using OpenCV and calculating \& storing a custom drowsiness index that is used to reward or deduct the driver's balance of a custom coin called VisCoin, implemented using IPFS and blockchain, hence incentivizing the driver to preclude traffic and road danger.
